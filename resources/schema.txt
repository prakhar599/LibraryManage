One-Many relationships:

There are several types of relationships between tables, but probably the most common is the one-to-many relationship,
which is often written as 1:N. This kind of relationship means that one row in a table (usually called 
the parent table) can have a relationship with many rows in another table (usually called child table).
Some common examples of one-to-many relationships are:
1.One customer may make several purchases, but each purchase is made by a single customer.
2.One company can have many phone numbers, but a phone number belongs to one company.



Many-Many relationships:

1.One professor could teach one or many subjects, but one subject could also be taught by
one or many professors. It seems it is an M:N relationship, so here’s how your logical model 
should look:



One-One relationship:
It’s a relationship where a record in one entity (table) is associated with exactly one record in
another entity (table).

1. Country - capital city: Each country has exactly one capital city.
Each capital city is the capital of exactly one country.
2. Person - their fingerprints. Each person has a unique set of fingerprints.
Each set of fingerprints identifies exactly one person
